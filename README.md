# quadratic-solver
pseudocode,used to implement the scenario

-at fist I imported a library called math to allow some operation to run with it's assistance
-then I accepted the input from the user by taking three values that I was in need of them
-I introduced the geerel formula of quadratic equation to check if it carries all requirments of qudratic equation and the general formula is given by disc= (b* b) - (4 * a* c)
-after that we will obtain two outputs and then we solve for further computations
-lastly print out the output obtained
